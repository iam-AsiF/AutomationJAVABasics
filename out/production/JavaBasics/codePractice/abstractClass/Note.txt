Abstract class - must have abstract keyword

- inside an Abstract class there can be multiple function with normal function
and abstract function
- if we want to make an abstract function the class should be Abstract class

- Abstract class cannot have a body { } - only functionName();

*** If we want to inherit an Abstract class on a non-Abstract class we should
  import all the Abstract methods inside the child class also. But if the child
  class is Abstract also we don't have to import all of them functions.
